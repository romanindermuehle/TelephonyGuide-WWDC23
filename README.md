# [Accepted] WWDC23 TelephonyGuide
![IntroductionLight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127976131/234668091-6050fe15-1d2a-4a0d-8a64-046d6fb54b5d.jpg)
## Story
In this app, you can learn the essentials about telephony. Back these days, when I started to learn the SIP protocol, I had wished that there was an app like this already available. But unfortunately, there was nothing comparable. Although, you can’t get enough information on the internet. But there, it is hard to find a course that is such interactive and teaches you the essentials of telephony within 3 minutes. Augmented Reality as a teaching form is very seldom. I know sometimes it can be tedious reading long web articles where it is not always easy to understand. Occasionally, you need to see something that you can understand how it works. 
That was my motivation to build this learn app. 

## Features
- Learn SIP within 3 minutes 
- Discover two AR scenes 
- Test your Knowledge after every lesson 
- Build in SwiftUI 

## What happens next
My goal is to develop this app further. Maybe with a small Chatbot feature. Where you can ask questions about the content in the lessons what you haven’t yet fully understood.  

To participate in the apple swift student challenge, I've built this app especially for the iPad in mind. But in the future versions, I will focus as well on optimising the app for the iPhone. 

## Installation
When you're interested in my app, you can clone this repository. Thereafter, you can either run it on your iPad or Mac. But the AR experience in camera mode isn't working through the Swift Playgrounds app on the iPad. Only in object mode. Instead, you need to run it on the Mac with Xcode and then installing on the iPad.
