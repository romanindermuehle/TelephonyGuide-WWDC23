Of course, this topic is also very complex if you want to understand how everything works.")

Of course, the app is reduced to the most important aspects, but there is still a lot more that would be interesting to explore. Even if you don't have the opportunity to experiment at home, my app offers two AR(Augmented Reality) scenes where you can experience telephony interactively.")
